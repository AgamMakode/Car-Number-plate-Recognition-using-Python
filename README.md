# Car-Number-plate-Recognition-using-Python

Build a Car number plate recognition program with the help of Python.

I have Used Visual Studio Code to build my project, and will be leveraging the power of open source software 
to make the magic happen, namely OpenCV. OpenCV is the open source machine learning library which mainly 
focus on image processing, video capture and features like face detection and Object detection.

So use pip install opencv-python command to install opencv library.

I have also uses Cascade classifier. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

First we install Opencv and load cascade classifier

Then we want that our module should read specific image therefore convert that image in Grey and created a box with x and y dimensions defines its height and width,which will focus on number plate of the car You can also change the font which ever You want.
